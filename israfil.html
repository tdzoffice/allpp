        <h1>Israfil Mobile App Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-03-20</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Israfil Mobile App ("App"), developed by Thaw De Zin, collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly.</p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Google Sign-In Information: When you sign in using Google Sign-In, we collect your basic user information such as name and email address. This information is used to identify you within the App and enable features that require user accounts.</p>
        <p>Location Data: The App uses your device's location information to find nearby halal shops. However, we do not store or track your location history within the App.</p>
        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and improve the App's core functionality, such as finding nearby halal shops.</li>
            <li>To authenticate users and enable features that require user accounts (e.g., reporting non-halal shops).</li>
            <li>To analyze user behavior and improve the App's performance and user experience (through Firebase Analytics).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: We use Google Maps to display the locations of halal shops within the App. Google Maps may collect additional location data directly from your device. Please refer to Google Maps' Privacy Policy for more information on their data collection practices: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a></li>
            <li>Firebase Analytics: We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage data to understand user behavior and improve the App. Firebase Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will not share your information with any other third-party services without your consent.</p>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your information for as long as your user account is active and necessary to provide the App's services. You can delete your account at any time, which will also delete your associated information.</p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. We will take steps to delete the information from our servers.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
